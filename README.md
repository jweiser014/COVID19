Access requirements
The volume of data this stream delivers is significant, such that prior experience working with Twitter data and having the necessary             infrastructure in place to process, store, and analyze the many millions of Tweets being generated every day is critical. We have                 introduced a dedicated application to ensure you have access to the capabilities required to effectively use the endpoint in service of           the public good. Prerequisites to that application include:

        You have an approved Twitter developer account
        You have demonstrable experience working with Twitter data in JSON format
        You have a clear plan and ability to support the ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis of streaming data at a scale of tens                  of millions of Tweets per day
        Your project is adherent with our developer terms and restricted use cases
        Your use case is non-commercial (for example, you do not plan to monetize the use of this data)
        Your use case supports the public good
        When the application is approved, you will need to activate the “COVID-19 stream” preview in the Labs dashboard.
